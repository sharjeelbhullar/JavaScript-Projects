# JavaScript-Projects

In this repo I'm going to try to create some basic and intermediate level projects for the learners who want to excel in their web development careers by exploring these tiny projects they can easily learn how frontend files will be created and interlinked with each other.

## Project 1 - Counter Applicaton

In this will try to count the number of clicks you did in the increment button or on the decrement button. After the value exceeding the limit of 10 the counter will be reset to zero.

## Project 2 - Prime Number Checker

A very popular project to check whether a number is prime or not. It will tell you how to find a number is prime or not and guide you how to use HTML and CSS with it to create small but impactful project.

## Project 3 - Check Palindrome

One of the most used project for the beginners to learn the pattern of the coding. In this project, I used to create a project which will take a word or a phrase and tell that whether it's a palindrome or not. Palindrome words or pharases means if we reverse a word or sentence both are exactly same which means in reverse order or in non-reverse order both are exactly same(cases not included if you write lower or upper case it will be coverted into lowercase and then compared that whether both are equal or not after reversing and before reversing).
